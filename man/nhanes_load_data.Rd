\usage{
nhanes_load_data(file_name, year, destination = tempdir(),
  demographics = FALSE, cache = TRUE, recode = FALSE,
  recode_data = FALSE, recode_demographics = FALSE,
  allow_duplicate_files = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{NHANES file name (e.g. "EPH") or a vector of filenames (e.g c("EPH", "GHB"))}

\item{year}{NHANES cycle year (e.g. "2007-2008") or a vector of cycle years}

\item{destination}{directory to download the files to}

\item{demographics}{include  demographics data into the dataset}

\item{cache}{whether to cache the file to disk}

\item{recode}{whether to recode the data and demographics (overrides other parameters)}

\item{recode_data}{whether to recode just the data}

\item{recode_demographics}{whether to recode just the demographics}

\item{allow_duplicate_files}{how to handle a request that has duplicate file names/cycle years. By default duplicates will be removed.}
}
\value{
if file_name or year is a vector, returns a list containing a data frame for each file_name. If file_name and year are both singletons, then a data frame is returned.
}
\description{
Download NHANES data files.
}
\details{
If you supply vectors for both file_name and year, then the vectors are paired and each file_name/year pair is downloaded.
For example, file_name = c("EPH, GHB"), year = c("2009-2010", "2011-2012") will download "EPH_F.XPT" and "EPH_G.XPT".
In other words, the function does not download every possible combination of file_name and year.

You can specify file names in several formats. In order of specificity:
You can supply the complete filename: "EPH_F.XPT"
You can supply the filename without an extension: "EPH_F"
You can supply the filename without a suffix: "EPH", year = "2009-2010"

If you are loading the same file across multiple years, you must supply the filename without a suffix so
that the correct suffix for each year can be used.

This function returns either a list or a data frame. If you load multiple files, the return value will always be a list. This is because
the columns may not match in between files.
If you load one file, the result will be a data frame.
